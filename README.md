Inspired heavily by WAVE by RealTutsGML, Escape the lasers is a hobby game that I had intended to create for a long 
time

The project is still incomplete, but for now it is playable

Created in Java, requires JDK 21 as a safe option , though it should run with other jdks

Any problems or issues please list out in the issues page

Peace out !
